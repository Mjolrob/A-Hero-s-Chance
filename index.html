                <p><strong>While the seventh week was more of an extension of the sixth week, it was still invaluable as it made me:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Start the tutorial</li>
                    <li>Test out clipping full-size image</li>
                    <li>Try flexible image with text wrapping</li>
                    <li>Add a flexible video container</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>A tutorial on Java?</strong></p>
                <p>This was the week that I started my tutorial page. I find it hard to decide what to do when I have many choices to choose from (or in this case, an almost infinite amount) so I chose to make my tutorial page about something relevant to what I am doing in my other modules: programming. My tutorial section will be about installing a Java IDE and being able to write some simple code to print ‘Hello World!’ onto the screen. I did this because while it is a relatively simple task, there are many steps to it and I can introduce simple, non-complex jargon as well (along with recommendations of IDEs and where to go after printing ‘Hello World!’).</p>

                <p>Due to there still being some more responsiveness lectures and tutorials left, I’m not going to go all out on it yet due to me wanting to avoid creating the tutorial page but then changing half of the HTML code and layout to be even <em>more</em> responsive.</p>

                <p><strong>Floating images</strong></p>
                <p>A good way to integrate images into the website is through text wrapping. This is where the text wraps around a flexible image instead of just blocking it, and this can be done with the CSS properties <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>.</p>

                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week7/floatexample.png" alt="An image float example" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                <p>The image to the right is what happens when the image ‘floats’ (in this case it floats to the right) and the image below is what happens when it doesn’t.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week7/floatexample.png" alt="An image float example" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p>I had actually done this before due to my independent research and studying, but Jennie's tutorial gave me more insight to how it worked and the meaning behind it.</p>

                <p><strong>Making a video flexible</strong></p>
                <p>This was quite new to me actually as I had never before added in a video into a website, let alone made it responsive and flexible, whilst also needing to declare the video height in a way where the 16:9 aspect ratio of the video was kept. To do this, I:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Used a test video ‘What's Brighton like at Christmas? | University of Brighton’ got the embedded code from YouTube.</li>

                    <li>Wrote new classes into CSS (with help from <a href="http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/tutorial07/tutorial07.html">Jennie’s seventh lab tutorial</a>). These classes are <code>.video-wrapper, iframe, .videoconatiner and .video-container iframe</code>.</li>

                    <li>Added in the following code into my tutorial’s HTML (again, with help from <a href="http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/tutorial07/tutorial07.html">Jennie’s seventh lab tutorial</a>).</li>

                    <li>Copied the following markup and placed this into in my tutorial's HTML -

                        <blockquote>
                            <pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; <br> src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrduBSGtkS4 allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                        </blockquote>

                    </li>

                </ol>

                    <h3><a id="week6"></a>Week 6: Becoming Responsive</h3>
                    <p>Edited on
                        <time datetime="2019-11-05"><strong>November 5th, 2019</strong></time>
                    </p>
                </header>

                <p><strong>To make the website responsive, certain changes needed to happen and certain additions needed to be added, so the sixth week was about:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adding the viewport meta element to the <code>head</code> of the document</li>
                    <li>Organising the style sheet</li>
                    <li>Setting up the responsive grid</li>
                    <li>Styling the small screen layout (mobile first approach)</li>
                    <li>Styling for different screen widths</li>
                    <li>Hiding elements (display:none)</li>
                    <li>Making images flexible</li>
                    <li>Testing the responsiveness of the web pages</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>The viewport meta tag</strong></p>
                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week6/metahome.png" alt="The viewport section of the index page" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week6/metatutorial.png" alt="The viewport section of the tutorial page" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week6/metacontact.png" alt="The viewport section of the contact page" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <p>The sixth week meant it was time to take the website’s responsiveness to the next level from how it was before. Since my web pages already had <code>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"</code> which allows devices to render the website at their own screen widths and not that of an average desktop. I also used my phone, some other peoples (friends and family) devices and also <a href="http://mobiletest.me/">MobileTest</a> to check my website was good at different devices and screen sizes (which I will check regularly). Chrome and Firefox also have built-in developer tools than you can use to resize your page to simulate different devices, which I will also use going forth.</p>

                <p><strong>Responsive grid</strong></p>

                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week6/mobilefirst.png" alt="The mobile first approach" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                <p>Now it was time to set up the responsive grid. The responsive grid makes it makes it easier to place elements on the page and allows sections of the web pages to be placed into segments which can slide into different positions depending on the screen size (which provides an excellent, unique viewing experience on tablets and mobile devices). Jennie <a href="http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/tutorial06/tutorial06.html#step2">provided the HTML and CSS</a> that was needed to make websites responsive which I utilised well. However, I had to spend a large chunk of time just rearranging and merging my old CSS stylesheet to the new one provided as they both had different layouts and the new one even had new features added in! Although it was a bit of trouble to add in, the new layout is definitely a lot better to have as it seems less like a page from pre-2010!</p>

                <p>I also went with the ‘mobile first approach’ which has the mobile devices in mind first as mobile devices tend to have more restrictions and is easier to expand the website onto tablets or desktops rather than regress down to mobile.</p>

                <p>Here is a before and after of adding in the responsive grid:</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week6/oldcss.png" alt="The old style of my website" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>
                <figure><img src="images/week6/newcss.png" alt="The new style of my website" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Hiding the cursed table</strong></p>

                <div class="fltlt"><img src="images/week6/hiddentable.png" alt="Code for the table to hide at a certain screen size" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                <p>On small mobile screens, the table is hidden due to its clumsiness and size working poorly on smaller devices.</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Make images flexible</strong></p>
                <p>The next leap to make the website responsive was to make the images <strong>flexible</strong>, which means that the images resize themselves based on the size of their parent element (which is the code <code>max-width: 100%;</code>) and won’t stretch off the page jarringly on smaller devices due to it resizing with its original aspect ratio. Due to this being done with CSS, the HTML <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> properties were no longer needed and were taken out.</p>

                <p><strong>Independant Research</strong></p>

                <p>After the tutorial, I was quite confused about how the <code>@media</code> stuff all worked and, like I said in Week 1, I need to know <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> something happens, or it doesn’t sit well with me. I looked at <a href=”https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp”>W3Schools’ section on responsive grid-views</a> and on <a href=”https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp”>media queries</a> which helped me understand it a bit more as they explained it as</p>

                <blockquote>web pages [being] based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into columns</blockquote>

                <p>and while that’s a sufficient explanation, I still wanted to know how it worked in a deeper fashion. I then stumbled upon <a href=”https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas”>Mozilla’s explanation of grid template areas </a> and that helped me immeasurably. They go into detail about how the layout works with naming grid areas and how to create a layout from them while providing code examples and pictures to compliment them.</p>

                <p>Thanks to this, I decided to experiment a tiny bit with the layout of my webpage.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week6/navtopside.png" alt="An alternate layout of my webpage with nav being prominent" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p>This was when I changed the layout to make the naviagtion section more prominent by changing the layout to:</p>

                <blockquote>"banner banner banner"

                    <br> "
                    <strong>nav</strong> main main"
                    <br> "
                    <strong>aside</strong> footer footer"
                    <br>
                </blockquote>

                <p>While this was a good layout, it is the same as the two-column tablet layout and didn't feel like it take advantage of a desktop's perks (size and space) so I didn't test this layout any further.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week6/linkstopside.png" alt="An alternate layout of my webpage with menu being prominent" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p>This was when I changed the layout to make the main section more prominent and slotting the menu at the side by changing the layout to:</p>

                <blockquote>"banner banner banner"
                    <br> "
                    <strong>menu   main   main</strong>"
                    <br> "nav main main"
                    <br> "aside main main"
                    <br> "footer footer footer"
                    <br>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This really didn't work and since I was just testing out different styles, I didn't want to waste time by experimenting with this.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week6/mainbelow.png" alt="An alternate layout of my webpage with main being below everything" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p>This was when I changed the layout to make the main section below nav and aside:</p>

                <blockquote>"banner banner banner"
                    <br> "menu menu menu"
                    <br> "
                    <strong>nav   table   aside</strong>"
                    <br> "
                    <strong>main   main   main</strong>"
                    <br> "footer footer footer"
                    <br>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This was the worst by far . This <em>could have worked</em> if either my reference section wasn't so plentiful or if I didn't have a reference section, but due to the fact I do it pushed my main section straight down by quite a distance (as the screenshot above shows very well....).</p>

                <p>Due to these not working, I have stuck with the layout that Jennie provided since it looks nice on a desktop and doesn't destroy any segments of the page.</p>

                <p>When I added the CSS in the previous week, all I did was change the sizes of some elements and changes a few colours on the background and such but now it was time to get <em>really</em> specific and make the small changed that add up. This includes me:</p>

                <ul>

                <p><strong>The font</strong></p>

                <div class="fltrt">
                    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/vis-fonts"><img src="images/week5/segoeuiexample.png" alt="An example of the Segoe UI font" style="max-width:100%;"></a>
                </div>

                <p>The font that I chose to go for is Segoe UI which is used by Microsoft. The reason for this is because, which I found out during my independent research, it is a comforting Sans-serif font with the text being soft and it was designed to be optimised for user interfaces (with its wide vertical gaps) and readable text strings across multiple languages. Microsoft themselves describe Segoe UI as
                    <blockquote>‘an approachable, open, and friendly typeface, and as a result has better readability than Tahoma, Microsoft Sans Serif, and Arial.’</blockquote> Microsoft also said that it was
                    <blockquote>‘designed to be a humanist sans serif with no strong character or distracting quirkiness.’</blockquote>

                    <p><strong>Styling the text</strong></p>

                    <p class="clear">With the line-height, I made it fairly spacious without it look like the sentences were trying to run away from each other since there is nothing worse than text spacing seeming off or improper as it can — and will — distract the viewer and put them off. I created space between the blocks of text with the margin property <code> margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;</code> so everything isn’t so cramped together and unnecessarily tight. Jennie explained in Tutorial 5 that, if there are several paragraphs of text on a page, then text-indents can improve legibility as it indents the first line of each paragraph. I tested this out and decided that it wasn’t for my website as I have a lot of new lines and it makes everything very disorientating (and I break up the text with images and <strong>strong</strong> <code>p</code> heading as well to improve legibility).</p>

                    <p><strong>Image positioning</strong></p>

                    <div class="fltlt"><img src="images/week5/floats.png" alt="The section of CSS that contains the floats and clear" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                    <p>Floating the images is another tool in the box to make the website visually pop out and have a more professional vibe as floating an image allows the text to wrap around it, which make the page seem more streamlined and less ‘blocky’. To do this, I had to create new classes in my CSS file which were <code>.fltlt</code> (<strong>fl</strong>oa<strong>t</strong> <strong>l</strong>ef<strong>t</strong>), <code>.fltrt</code> (<strong>fl</strong>oa<strong>t</strong> <strong>r</strong>igh<strong>t</strong>) and <code>.clear</code> (<strong>clear</strong>s the float at a specified point so it doesn’t keep on going and unwantedly affect the web page) (the names were provided by Jennie but they are relevant and easy to remember so I didn’t change them) and then place the <code>img</code> into a <code>div </code> with the code <code>div class="fltlt/flrrt"</code> and clearing the float with <code> class="clear"</code>.</p>

                    <p>Some images flow better without floating around text, so while I won’t use the float sparingly, I will make decision on where and not to use it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Independent Research</strong></p>
                    <p>To start off my independent learning, I looked extensively at different types of fonts or more specifically sans-serif fonts. The reason I focused on sans-serif was because is cleaner and more minimal so it’s easier to view and better to read text on websites that use sans-serif fonts such as Arial, Helvetica and Geneva. I mainly looked at Microsoft’s own sans-serif font ‘Segoe’ as I’ve always owned computers that use Microsoft Windows OS and I haven’t yet come across a clearer, easier and better-looking font. I more specifically centred in on ‘Segoe UI’ that Microsoft use for their user interfaces and looked on Microsoft’s own website to find out more about the font and to find out why they created it and what makes it special (which I quoted in ‘The Font’ section of Week 5). Since they created it to be accessible, friendly and have superior readability I thought that it would be a no-brainer to use it as my primary font.</p>

                    <p>Although I had pretty much made my mind on what font I was going to use, I still wanted to investigate and test out more fonts. I used Geneva (a 'Realist' sans-serif font):</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/genevafont.png" alt="The Geneva font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>Helvetica:</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/helveticafont.png" alt="The Helvetica font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>Lucida:</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/lucidafont.png" alt="The Lucida font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>Verdana:</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/lucidafont.png" alt="The Verdana font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>The default font:</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/defaultwebfont.png" alt="The default web font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>And Segoe UI:</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/week5/segoeuicomparisonfont.png" alt="The Segoe UI font" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                    <p>Through doing this, I did like Geneva and Lucida, so I made them fallback fonts (used if the primary font doesn't work) in case the viewer of my website doesn't have Segoe UI.</p>

                    <p>The only text that doesn't use these fonts is the text that has the <code>code</code> class which uses the Courier (a monospaced slab serif font) font to differentiate when I am using the code tag and because it has a nice <code>raw, stereotypical code-like feel to it.</code></p>

                </header>
                <p><strong>When we hit the fourth week, it was time to add the missing piece to my website. It was time to <em>really</em> give it the nutrients it needed: CSS. I did this by:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Linking <code>normalise.css</code> to my index
                        <li>Linking <code>stylesheet.css</code> to my index
                            <li>Styling the <code>body</code> (and other elements) of my web pages
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Normalising the pages</strong></p>

                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week4/stylesheets.png" alt="Normalise and stylesheet linked to my web pages" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                <p>Before adding <code>stylesheet.css</code> to my web pages, I needed to add something that is equally as important in improving my website: <code>normalise.css</code>. This is a stylesheet that gives cross-browser consistency with rendering the elements of a web page and does it within modern standards. To get <code>normalise.css</code> (version 8.0.0) I went to the link <a href=https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/>provided by Jennie,</a> and to add it to the pages all I had to do was add <code>link href="css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet"</code> into the <code>head</code> section of my web pages.</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>The CSS</strong></p>

                <p>Afterwards it was time for the main event, the <code>stylesheet.css</code>. Jennie provided a basic template for me to use where the tags were arranged into a logical order for easy editing.</p>

                <div class="fltrt"><img src="images/week4/bodywrapper.png" alt="The code of the stylesheet" style="max-width:100%;"></div>

                <p>Editing the stylesheet was going to be very trial and error sue to me trying to figure out what is what and how changing X will affect Y and so forth. I made the body colour a nice light grey (#f7f7f7) and the wrapper colour white (#ffffff). The reason I did this was because any colour can go with white and light grey so if I wanted to add red, blue, purple or anything then I don’t have to worry about matching colours. I made the font size use <code>em</code> instead of <code>px</code> due to it complimenting responsive websites much better thanks to Jennie’s input when I asked her about the difference between font-size types.</p>

                <p>I made the heading all the same shade of colour; which is blue (could change in the future). This is so that there isn’t too many colours clashing with each other and with a (fairly) simple website that I am making, it doesn’t need a large array of colours overwhelming the page.</p>

                <p>Since the <code>stylesheet.css</code> is ever-changing, it will be difficult to write about everything I am changing since it will be constant tweaks and additions, but any large noteworthy changes will be documented in my Learning Journal in the weeks ahead.</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Validating the CSS</strong></p>

                <p>You can validate the CSS like you can with the HTML from <a href=https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>here</a> to which I will do frequently to make sure I am being efficient and proper with my increasing website development skills.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/week4/nocsserrors.png" alt="No errors with my CSS stykesheet" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p><strong>Independent Research</strong></p>

                <p>Since this week was all to do with the CSS, I wanted to put in a lot of time to help me really grasp what CSS can do and how I can use it efficiently. I began with looking at the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics>CSS basics</a> from Mozilla and absorbing the information such as what declarations and property values are. It goes through the fundamentals in a comprehensive manner which is exactly what I wanted (such as fonts and box models).</p>

                <p>I then started reading through font styling and how you can manipulate text with colour, size (px, em and rem), types of fonts (serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy), common fonts (Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Verdana) and so on. I decided to use <code>em</code> after talking to Jennie and through my independent research as although <code>rem</code> is an ‘easier’ <code>em</code>, it is not supported by Internet Explorer 8 and below which is an issue as my website is supposed to work on all devices. I also learnt of font-style which is the <em>italic</em> text and the <em>oblique</em> text (which I never heard of before), font-weight which is <strong>bold</strong> and <strong>bolder</strong>, and font-decoration which is underlining text, overlining text or shoving a line though the text.</p>

                <p>I stumbled upon a way that you can give text multiple shadows, although this looked hideous and cheap to me so I was immediately put off from it.</p>

                <p>The website has a grand list of random text layout styles such as:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>text-overflow</strong> which defines how overflowed content that can't be shown is signalled to viewers</li>
                        <li><strong>word-break</strong> which defines whether to break lines within words</li>
                        <li><strong>direction</strong> which tells the text direction (although this depends on the language)</li>
                        <li><strong>hyphens</strong> which toggles hyphenation (for supported languages)</li>
                        <li><strong>text-orientation</strong>: which defines the orientation the text</li>
                        <li><strong>overflow-wrap</strong> which tells the browser whether or not it can break lines within words in order to prevent overflow off the web page</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I also looked up a tiny bit about class selectors due to me wanting to arrange my images in a certain place (which is called floating) but as that will be covered next week, I didn’t worry too much about going crazy with it right now. When I got stuck on how to use and edit CSS segments, I would use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">Mozilla's CSS reference</a> to help me understand how whatever I was trying to do worked and could be manipulated so that I could remember it for the future.</p>

                <p>The third week came and a third go at growing my website came with it. Week 2 was mainly about lists and tags, and Week 3 would carry this on with some extra additions to go along with it.</p>

                <p><strong>Week 3 concluded and the index, once again, improved drastically with new features. These new features were:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Adding two new types of lists: nested lists (a combination of lists/a list inside a list) and description lists (what it says on the tin)
                        <li>Adding a table — or more specifically my University time table — at the top of the home page
                            <li>Adding quote text
                                <li>Transforming an image into links to external websites

                <p>The third week started with most lists: the nested list and the definition list (that I looked up before in Week 2). Nested lists are just where you put a list into a list so that was fine for me as I had already done that in my test environment in Week 2. </p>

                <figure><img src="images/week3/list.png" alt="The link to two types of lists!" style="max-width:100%;"></figure>

                <p>I hadn’t done description lists before, although I did come across them during my previous independent research. They are a bit more complex sine you need three tags instead of just two (with ordered and unordered lists) which are <code>dl</code> (starts the description list), <code>dt</code> (the terms), <code>dd</code> (the description). Going forth, I will only use these for their named purpose for descriptions of jargon and noteworthy content.</p>

                <p><strong>The pain known as tables....</strong></p>

                <div class="fltlt">
                    <img src="images/week3/table.png" alt="An image of the code of my table" style="max-width:100%;">
                </div>

                <p>Before we started the table, Jennie told us that tables were annoying, fiddly and just generally difficult to make and debug. I thought that it couldn’t have been <em>that</em> bad, but if anything, she undersold it….</p>

                <p>Due to what Jennie said, I immediately threw together a basic table in my test environment to get a feel of how they work. After a short amount of time I could see how much if a pain they will be when trying to add columns and rows and then fill them in with meaningful data. It’s bad enough that there are four tags to use but when you need to write downwards for the data to go into the neighbouring row, it can get a bit messy. I made a few errors with where my data was placed in the tables (data that I wanted to be placed in a column would be placed in a row and vice versa) but after taking it slow and evaluating how tables work I eventually became proficient in getting it right.</p>

                <p class="clear">Jennie said in <a href="http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/tutorial03/tutorial03.html">Tutorial 3</a> that ‘it's a good thing that we no longer need to use tables for layout’ and she is definitely right!</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Quoting the sources</strong></p>

                <p>The next step was to include the sources I use that helped me along the journey or my Learning Journal but not as hyperlinks but as <strong>quotes</strong>. The quotes can come from many sources such as from a website, a book, a magazine or even my lecturer Jennie!</p>

                <p>Due to me potentially using many different sources during my work, it is vital that I keep up to date with this and don't ignore it!</p>

                <p><strong>Transforming the images</strong></p>

                <div class="fltrt">
                    <img src="images/week3/imagelinks.png" alt="An image turned into a clickable link" style="max-width:100%;">
                </div>

                <p>The final addition of the third week was making an image (or images in my case with the glossary) into a link. This was rather simple to do as all you needed to do was add in <code>a /a</code> and <code>href</code>.</p>

                <p class="clear"></p>

                <p><strong>Independent Research</strong></p>

                <p>There wasn’t much independent learning for me as I grasped the third week very well and didn’t struggle at all. Although with that in mind, I did have to look up in depth how to do tables as they were just a pain when I started to do my timetable. To do this I used two resources from W3Schools, which were the web pages <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">'W3Schools HTML tables'</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp">'W3Schools HTML table tag'</a> as they both went in depth with examples on how tables work.</p>

                </header>
                <p>The second week came around and it was time for the website to be built upon. It can't be as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle, just like it can't be as deep as the Mariana Trench but as wide a child's inflatable garden paddling pool; so there has to be a balance.</p>

                <p><strong>The second week came to a close, and the website was better for it. The numerous additions that were added and expanded upon were:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Creating a testing environment called 'fruit'!
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>This is the page I use to test all new features or what have you before I introduce them onto the main page. This allows me to iron them out and get an understanding of how the new feature works</em>
                        </ul>

                        <figure>

                        </figure>

                        <li>Me beginning to include proper, relevant material to my Learning Journal and adding publication dates to the weekly posts
                            <li>Including both ordered and unordered lists to buff up the page
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>I made a conscious effort to not overuse them on the page as then the content will start breaking down and become unenjoyable for the reader</em>
                                </ul>

                                <figure>

                                </figure>

                                <figure>
                                    <img src="images/week2/ulexample.png" alt="An example of an unordered list" style="max-width:100%;">
                                </figure>

                                <li>Using anchors so the page can be navigated through efficiently and effectively for the reader

                                    <li>Adding relevant images (mainly to the weekly posts) to the website using the tag <code>img /</code>
                                        <li>Add in a mailto: email link on all three pages at the bottom of each page.
                </ol>

                <p><strong>The testing environment! Fruit.html!</strong></p>

                <p>Since later in the course I was going to start adding in uncharted features (to me), I needed a dedicated location to where I can test features and really get a feel of how they work. Due to this, I created a page dedicated to a simple yet in depth topic: fruit.</p>

                <p>This allowed me to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Paste walls and walls to text so I can get down the layout of my page
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/week2/fruitwall.png" alt="An example of a large block of text in the test environment" style="max-width:100%;">
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Add in different lists of fruit so I can get used to how lists work
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/week2/fruitlist.png" alt="An example of a list of fruit in the test environment" style="max-width:100%;">
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Add in absolute links to the Wikipedia pages of different fruits so I can become accustomed to linking websites for my main page
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/week2/fruitwikilink.png" alt="An example of a Wikipedia link about fruit in the test environment" style="max-width:100%;">
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adding in images of fruit so I can get used to placing images and resizing them around my web page
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/week2/fruitimage.png" alt="An example of an image of fruit in the test environment" style="max-width:100%;">
                </figure>

                <p>While the test page is ugly and inconsistent, it will definitely grow to be a random but undeniably useful and invaluable page in the future that I would keep on referring to constantly.</p>

                <p><strong>Content and dates!</strong></p>

                <p>To begin the second week, I started to write about the process and journey of making the interactive website you are on today while replacing the placeholder <em>Lorem ipsum</em> text that I used to get a feel of the page. When adding the publication dates to my posts, I did it (thanks to <a href=" http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/tutorial02.html">Jennie Harding’s Lab tutorial</a>) in the <strong>ISO-8601</strong> standard format of year, month then day (YYYY-MM-DD). I also made the publication dates with the <code>strong</code> tag for it to stand out and add an extra punch to them.</p>

                <p><strong>Lists here and everywhere!</strong></p>

                <p>Then I got to the list section, which is what really put my Learning Journal on the next level, as they not only order the text and make everything more coherent, but they also visually strengthen the page. There are two lists — that are the two most widely used — that were used on my page were the <strong>unordered lists</strong> (bullet pointed lists) and the <strong>ordered lists</strong> (numbered lists). Going forward, I will typically reserve the ordered lists for the weekly posts where I go over what happened and will use the unordered lists for either expanding on subjects or for, well, unordered lists…. I will also make a conscious effort to not overuse either on my website as then (like I stated before) the content will start breaking down and become unenjoyable for the reader.</p>

                <p>Due to my interests in the different types of lists, <a href="https://webplatform.github.io/docs/guides/html_lists/">I looked up other types of lists</a> and found the <strong>description list</strong> which is typically used for terms and definitions. This will be very useful for me as I can include definitions for the jargon of website development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, W3Schools and potentially others.</p>

                <p><strong>Anchor tags</strong></p>

                <p>Then I got to the anchor tags which were surprisingly easier to do than I thought that they might have been. This is because all I had to do for the anchor tags was:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create an anchor at the section on the web page that I wanted to have a link to
                        <li>Then create a link via text to that anchor I made before from another part of the page (which I placed the links at the top for convenience to the reader)
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Adding images</strong></p>

                <p>After the anchor tags, it was time for the page to really get an upgrade visually: images. Any web page can benefit from an image or two and mine was no exception especially since it is a personalised Learning Journal as images would be no less than expected. In the Tutorial, Jennie made it very clear that it is important to use <strong>copyright-free images</strong> and linked us to two resources where we could find copyright-free media (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>). Even though the great majority of images were going to be my own screenshots and so forth, I made sure to remembered it going forth.</p>

                <p>Due to images being at different sizes, I had to become close friends to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attribute otherwise I would have images shooting straight off the screen, or just engulfing the screen (which would be an utter disaster!).</p>

                <p><strong>Email links</strong></p>

                <div class="fltrt">
                    <img src="images/week2/email.png" alt="The footer including a link to my personal email" style="max-width:100%;">
                </div>

                <p>I added in a direct email link to each page at the footer, which was done with the simple use of a <code>mailto:</code> attribute.</p>

                <p class="clear"></p>

                <p><strong>Independent Research</strong></p>

                <p>During my independent research, I looked through (which I did a tiny bit in the previous week) the different <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">types of tags (from Mozilla)</a> and their meanings. I would also test tags in my test environment, although these were just random tests and were not anything noteworthy.</p>

                <p>The first week was the start of the website, the foundation of the future laboratory sessions. While the things we did were pretty simple, it was crucial that they were so the base of the website was concrete and could be built upon in the following weeks without anything going haywire.</p>

                <p><strong>So the first laboratory session concluded and a simple 3-page website remained, to which I learned — or reacquainted myself with — how to do the following things:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Setting up the folders and files for (<a href="https://rib13.brighton.domains/journal/index.html">my site</a>) on the <a href="https://brighton.domains/">Brighton Domains</a> web server

                            <li><em>The parent folder is called ‘public_html’ and contains two child folders called ‘images’ and ‘css’</em>

                                </ul>

                <p>The syntax of the pages that I created above abide by the rules of <strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict</strong> for compatibility reasons (so the pages can work on all browsers and devices). There were specific syntax rules that had to be followed, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Elements being nested properly
                        <li>Elements being closed (as well as self-closing tags)
                            <li>Elements and attributes being written in lowercase
                </ul>

                <p>Since the first week was just covering the basics and went over what I already knew, I didn’t put that much time into independent research during this time. I did however look through W3Schools and read their definitions on the common tags as it is important for me, personally, to know <em>why</em> something happens and have numerous information sources in my mind.</p>
